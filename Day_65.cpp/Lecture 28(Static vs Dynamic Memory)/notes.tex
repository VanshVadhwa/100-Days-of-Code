1. Reference Variable: Same memory but various names. Example: int i=5, 5 can also be called by a variable j

2. Heap memory: It is used for dynamic memory allocation

Note: Stack Memory = Static Memory allocation
      Heap Memory: Dynamic Memory allocation

3. int *arr = new int[n];
//Suppose n = 50, so (new int[n]) is taking 200 bytes in heap memory and (int *arr) is taking 4 bytes .
and if it is written simply that int arr[50] then it means that it is taking 200 bytes on stack memory only.

4. int *p = new int;
int *ptr = p;

// Assigning the value 5 to the memory location pointed to by p
*p = 5; //This is allocated in heap memory

cout << "Value at ptr: " << *ptr << endl;
cout << "Value at p: " << *p << endl;
//Above 2 and below 2 are giving same outputs
cout << "Address at ptr: " << ptr << endl;
cout << "Address at p: " << p << endl;

Homework: void pointer, address type casting, code studio guided path
