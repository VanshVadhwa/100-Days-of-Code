Note: If I have to make an array, I bring multiple int type of blocks but if I have to make a 2D array, the I have to bring multiple rows.
And as we know that one row is denoted as (int *p=new int[50]), so to bring multiple row, we have to write this array as (int** arr=new int*[n])

What I have learnt today?
1. How to create a 2D arry dynamically
2. Input/Output
3. Memory free kaise karni hai

Homework: Make a jaggered array dynamically
